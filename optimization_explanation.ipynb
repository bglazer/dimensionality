    "I have been considering the problem of minimizing the Jaccard distance in two dimensions. Ad-hoc visual analysis and comparison on 2d projected data is a common step in bioinformatics. As shown in [1], most dimensionality reduction methods don't preserve Jaccard distance, especially in two dimensions. Minimizing AJD in 2d reduces the risk of spurious conclusions resulting from neighborhood distortion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach presented in [1] finds a lower dimensional projection that minimizes the AJD, where the lower dimension is hypothesized to represent the true dimensionality of the underlying manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that the Jaccard distance is non-smooth and discontinuous, it's quite difficult to directly optimize. In order to optimize, we first project to 2d using fast, standard techniques like PCA. We then convert the discrete neighborhood constraint into an inequality, and optimize the resulting expression with gradient descent.\n",
